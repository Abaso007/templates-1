# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature. For insecure data storage findings, please include a screenshot of the data being stored unencrypted by the application.

Attempt to abuse the insecure data storage by demonstrating that the unencrypted data could be used by a malicious attacker in some impactful way. If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept (PoC).
