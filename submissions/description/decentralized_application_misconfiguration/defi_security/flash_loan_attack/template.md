A flash loan allows the borrowing of a large sum of capital without collateral as the loan must be returned to the lending platform at the end of a transaction block. A flash loan attack involves  an attacker borrowing large amounts to manipulate asset prices in liquidity pools or decentralized exchanges, arbitraging between manipulated prices across protocols, or exploiting vulnerabilities in smart contracts to drain liquidity. Through these methods an attacker is able to manipulate the logic of asset bonding curves and destabilize market prices.

**Business Impact**

Flash loan attacks can result in significant financial losses as well as a loss of user trust, and damage to the platformâ€™s reputation. Additionally, businesses may face legal consequences and regulatory scrutiny which can lead to financial losses and penalties.
