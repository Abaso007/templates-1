# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures in the decentralized application can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Use failsafes to detect abnormal pricing shifts and pause the protocol if manipulation is detected. Set thresholds for price volatility ranges for all assets within the dApp (these can be based on historical data, statistical models, and normal market activity). 
- Ensure that accurate and real-time price feeds are used from decentralized oracles.
- Use time weighted average price or volume weighted average price to smooth short-term volatility.
- Enable circuit breakers to pause the system in the event of large, suspicious transactions.
- Continuously monitor for sudden spikes or reductions in liquidity or trading volumes that might signal manipulation.
