# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures in the decentralized application can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Implement strict geolocation checks using IP and blockchain analysis tools to block users from sanctioned jurisdictions.
- Introduce robust Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures to validate user identities before allowing transactions.
- Regularly update the platformâ€™s list of sanctioned entities and cross-reference it with all active users.
- Automate compliance checks to flag and block users violating OFAC restrictions.
