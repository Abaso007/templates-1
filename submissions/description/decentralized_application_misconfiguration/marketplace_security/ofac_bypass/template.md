Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) bypass refers to the failure of a marketplace to properly enforce OFAC sanctions or restrictions. This can happen due to insufficient compliance mechanisms, such as missing geolocation checks or improper validation of user identities, allowing sanctioned entities to engage in transactions.

**Business Impact**  

Allowing sanctioned entities to use the platform could result in severe legal consequences, including fines, regulatory penalties, and sanctions against the marketplace itself. Additionally, reputational damage can occur if users or regulators perceive the platform as not complying with global laws and standards.

**Steps to Reproduce**  

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Create a user from a sanctioned country or entity
1.  Bypass geolocation checks or identity verification to register on the platform
1. Execute trades, transfers, or listings as the sanctioned entity
1. Observe that the marketplace does not block or restrict the user based on their location or identity
