# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures in the decentralized application can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Implement consistent, tamper-proof fee and pricing logic across both the front-end and back-end.
- Regularly audit fee calculation and pricing mechanisms for potential vulnerabilities.
- Use cryptographic proofs to validate that prices and fees are correctly calculated before executing transactions.
- Introduce alerts for unusually low fees or sudden price changes in transactions.
