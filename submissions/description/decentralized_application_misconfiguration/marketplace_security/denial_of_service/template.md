Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities occur when attackers overload the marketplace with excessive transactions, requests, or interactions, causing it to become unavailable or unresponsive. This can result from a lack of rate limiting, unoptimized smart contract functions, or exploitable transaction loops. An attacker can overwhelm a marketplace through DoS, preventing legitimate users from accessing services.

**Business Impact**  

A successful DoS attack can render the platform unusable, leading to significant downtime, loss of revenue, and frustrated users. It also exposes the marketplace to reputational damage, as users may seek alternatives if the platform is frequently unavailable due to attacks.

**Steps to Reproduce**  

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Identify a vulnerable marketplace function that allows unlimited interactions
1. Spam the vulnerable function with excessive requests {{Describe exactly how}}
1. Observe the marketplaceâ€™s performance as it becomes unresponsive or crashes
1. Observe that legitimate users are unable to access the marketplace or complete transactions
