# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures in the decentralized application can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Implement rate limiting on all marketplace interactions, including order placements, asset queries, and transactions.
- Optimize smart contract functions to handle large numbers of interactions without degrading performance.
- Use monitoring tools to detect unusual spikes in traffic and throttle malicious activity in real-time.
- Establish backup and failover systems to keep the marketplace operational in the event of an attack.
