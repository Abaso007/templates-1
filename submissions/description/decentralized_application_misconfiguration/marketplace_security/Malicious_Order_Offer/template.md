A malicious order offer involves an attacker creating fraudulent or malicious order offers designed to deceive users into accepting terms that favor the attacker. This is often caused by a lack of order verification mechanisms or misleading metadata. Users may accept these malicious offers without realizing they are unfavorable or fraudulent.

**Business Impact**  

Users who fall victim to malicious orders may lose assets or overpay for goods, leading to financial losses and diminished trust in the marketplace. The platform may face legal repercussions for allowing fraudulent activities and could suffer reputational damage as users leave for more secure alternatives.
