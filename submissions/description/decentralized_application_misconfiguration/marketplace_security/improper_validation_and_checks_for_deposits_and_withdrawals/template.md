Improper validation and checks for deposits and withdrawals occur when the marketplace fails to adequately verify user deposits or withdrawals, leading to potential double-spending, unauthorized transactions, or incorrect balances. This misconfiguration is caused by poor validation logic or synchronization issues between the marketplace and external wallets.

**Business Impact** 
 
Incorrect validation can lead to financial discrepancies, enabling attackers to withdraw funds without proper deposits or double-spend assets. It may also cause user dissatisfaction due to incorrect balances, damaging the platformâ€™s reputation and leading to potential legal disputes.

**Steps to Reproduce**  

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Deposit funds into a marketplace account
1. Identify and exploit any inconsistencies in the validation or synchronization logic between the marketplace and the external wallet
1. Trigger a withdrawal request that exceeds the deposited amount or simulate multiple withdrawals in quick succession
1. Observe that the account balances to verify that unauthorized or excess withdrawals were successful
