# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures in the decentralized application can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Implement strict validation mechanisms for deposits and withdrawals, ensuring that transactions are fully confirmed before allowing withdrawals.
- Use decentralized oracles to verify external wallet balances and ensure synchronization with the marketplace.
- Regularly audit the deposit and withdrawal logic for potential vulnerabilities.
- Introduce rate limits and monitoring to prevent multiple withdrawal attempts in a short period.
