# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures in the decentralized application can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Implement strict access control measures and permission systems to verify ownership before allowing asset transfers.
- Introduce multi-signature requirements for high-value asset transfers.
- Regularly audit smart contracts to ensure proper authorization logic is enforced.
- Log and monitor all asset transfer activities, with alerts for suspicious transactions.
