# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures in the decentralized application can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Implement safe mathematical operations in smart contracts, including safeguards against integer overflows and underflows.
- Regularly audit and test accounting logic for rounding errors or other flaws.
- Use precise decimal handling to ensure accurate balance calculations across transactions.
- Establish independent validation checks for all balance updates and asset transfers.
