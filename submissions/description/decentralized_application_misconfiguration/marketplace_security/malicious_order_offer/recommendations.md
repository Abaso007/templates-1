# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures in the decentralized application can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Enforce strict validation and verification processes for order offers, ensuring terms are clear and transparent.
- Implement user alerts for unusually high or suspicious order offers.
- Audit the metadata and descriptions associated with each order to prevent deceptive practices.
- Educate users on how to recognize potentially malicious offers and encourage double-checking before acceptance.
