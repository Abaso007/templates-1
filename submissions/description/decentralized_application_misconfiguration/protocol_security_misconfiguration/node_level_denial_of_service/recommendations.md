# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Implement rate limiting on all nodes to restrict excessive requests from a single source.
- Use load balancers to distribute requests across nodes efficiently.
- Monitor node health in real-time, and automatically scale resources in response to increased demand.
- Establish alerting mechanisms for abnormal traffic patterns and implement automated mitigation strategies.
