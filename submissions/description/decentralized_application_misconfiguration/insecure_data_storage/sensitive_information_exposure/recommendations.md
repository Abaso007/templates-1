# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures in the decentralized application can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Use strong encryption algorithms to encrypt sensitive information both at rest and in transit before storing them.
- Only use and store the minimum amount of sensitive information necessary for the function of the application. Remove or anonymise sensitive information when it is no longer needed.
- Use access controls to limit who and what can access the sensitive information.
- Conduct regular security audits to ensure compliance with relevant privacy regulations of your applicationâ€™s user base.
