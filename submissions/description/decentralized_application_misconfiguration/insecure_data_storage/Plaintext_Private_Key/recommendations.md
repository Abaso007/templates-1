# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures in the decentralized application can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

-  Avoid storing private keys in the browserâ€™s `localStorage` or other insecure client-side storage mechanisms. Use more secure alternatives, such as session-based tokens or encrypted cookies.
- Use strong encryption algorithms to encrypt private keys before storing them.
- Implement secure key management practices, such as using hardware security modules or key vaults for sensitive key storage.
- Use access controls to limit who and what can access sensitive key storage.
