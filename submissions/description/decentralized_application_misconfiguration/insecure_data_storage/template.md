Insecure data storage occurs when a decentralized application (dApp) improperly stores sensitive information, such as private keys, personally identifiable information (PII), or protected health information (PHI). This can happen due to plaintext storage, lack of encryption, or improper access controls. An attacker can exploit this to access or exfiltrate sensitive data, leading to privacy violations and security breaches.

**Business Impact**  

Data breaches caused by insecure storage can lead to significant financial losses, regulatory penalties, and reputational harm. Affected users may lose trust in the platform, further damaging its credibility.

**Steps to Reproduce**  

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Review the storage implementation for sensitive data in the dApp  
1. Analyze the use of encryption and access controls for data protection  
1. Attempt to retrieve sensitive data without authorization
1. Observe any unauthorized access or data exposure
