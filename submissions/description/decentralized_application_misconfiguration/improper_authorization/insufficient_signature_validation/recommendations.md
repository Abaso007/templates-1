# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures in the decentralized application can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Use strict signature verification methods to check that the senderâ€™s public key matches the signature and that no modifications of the transaction details can occur.
- Implement replay protection mechanisms to prevent attackers from reusing valid signatures for unauthorized transactions.
- Use established cryptographic libraries that handle signature verification securely and correctly.
- Conduct regular security audits of smart contracts and their transaction handling mechanisms to identify potential weaknesses in signature validation.
- For high value or sensitive transactions, consider implementing multi-signature authorization that include multiple private keys to sign off on the action before it is executed.
