# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Use role-based access control (RBAC) and enforce least privilege principles.  
- Regularly test and audit authorization logic for vulnerabilities.  
- Implement robust authentication mechanisms to verify user identities.  
- Use automated tools to detect and prevent authorization bypasses.
