# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature. For this finding, please include a screenshot of the binary being vulnerable to some known exploit, the application running.

Attempt to show that the lack of binary hardening could be used by a malicious attacker in some impactful way. If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept (PoC).
