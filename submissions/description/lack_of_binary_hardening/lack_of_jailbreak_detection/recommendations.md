# Recommendation(s)

It is recommended to implement exploit mitigation controls within the application that prevent an attacker from analyzing, reverse engineering, or performing unauthorized code modifications. This can include leveraging jailbreak detection frameworks and libraries specifically designed to identify jailbroken (or rooted Android) devices. A good framework will monitor the runtime environment and check for the presence of known jailbreak files and directories.
