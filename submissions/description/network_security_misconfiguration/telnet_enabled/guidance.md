# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

For this finding, please include a video of sensitive information being copied to the clipboard inside the application, and the same information being pasted somewhere else to show that it was successfully copied.

Attempt to abuse the system clipboard being enabled by showing that a malicious application with clipboard access could use the information in some impactful way. If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept (PoC).
