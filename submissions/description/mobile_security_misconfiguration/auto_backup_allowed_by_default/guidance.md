# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

For this finding, include a screenshot of either the application's data included within an android backup file, or a screenshot of the application's manifest file showing the line `android:allowBackup="true"` in the application's manifest file.

Attempt to abuse the information stored within the android application backup in some impactful way. If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept (PoC).
