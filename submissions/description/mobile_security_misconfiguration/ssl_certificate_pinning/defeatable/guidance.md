# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

For this finding, please include a screenshot or video of the application HTTP traffic being routed through a HTTP interception proxy, demonstrating that the application does not implement certificate pinning securely.

Attempt to show that the defeatable certificate pinning could be used by a malicious attacker in some impactful way. If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept (PoC).
