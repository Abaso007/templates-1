Lack of network segmentation in a cloud environment means that different logical components are not adequately isolated from each other within the virtual network. This allows an attacker who compromises one component to move laterally across the network to other systems and access sensitive information.

**Business Impact**

This vulnerability can lead to reputational damage and loss of customer trust, as well as potential regulatory fines and legal action.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Identify two or more cloud resources that should be logically isolated and reside within the same virtual network: {{resource A}} and {{resource B}}
2. From Resource A, establish a direct network connection to Resource B, bypassing intended security controls: {{connection attempt command}}
3. Observe that the connection is successfully established, demonstrating the lack of proper segmentation between the two resources

**Proof of Concept**
