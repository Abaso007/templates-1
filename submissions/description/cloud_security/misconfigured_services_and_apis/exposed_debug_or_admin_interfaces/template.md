Web-based or API-driven control panels that provide privileged access to cloud applications or underlying infrastructure can be exposed to the internet or an untrusted network segment. These exposed debug or admin interfaces often lack robust authentication or have default credentials, which can allow an attacker to gain full control over systems and data.

**Business Impact**

This vulnerability can result in financial losses and regulatory fines, as well as reputational damage and a loss of customer trust.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Use web scanners, directory brute-forcing tools, or public search engines to identify potentially exposed debug or admin interfaces: {{scanning tool or search query used}}
2. Navigate to the identified interface URL: {{URL}}
3. Attempt to log in using default credentials, common weak passwords, or by bypassing authentication mechanisms: {{login attempt credentials}}
4. Observe that unauthorized access to the debug or admin interface is gained, allowing control over the application or infrastructure
