Misconfigured services and API issues refer to a broad category of vulnerabilities arising from improper setup, default settings, or inadequate hardening of cloud services and their APIs. This can include exposed admin and debug interfaces, as well as insecure API configurations. An attacker can exploit misconfigured services and APIs to gain unauthorized access to data, cause service disruptions, or abuse resources.

**Business Impact**

This vulnerability can result in financial losses and regulatory fines, as well as reputational damage and a loss of customer trust.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Identify the following cloud service or API that appears to be running with default or insecure configurations: {{service or API}}
1. Look at the configuration settings, default permissions, and exposed functionalities of the service/API: {{review method or tool}}
1. Interact with the service/API with the following payload: {{exploit action or payload}}
1. Observe that the misconfiguration allows unintended access, data leakage, or service manipulation
