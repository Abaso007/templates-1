Individual API paths or methods can be vulnerable due to design flaws, improper input validation, or insufficient authorization checks for specific operations. An attacker can exploit misconfigured services and APIs to gain unauthorized access to data, cause service disruptions, or abuse resources.

**Business Impact**

This vulnerability can result in financial losses and regulatory fines, as well as reputational damage and a loss of customer trust.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Identify an API endpoint that processes sensitive data or performs critical actions: {{sensitive api endpoint URL}}
2. Craft a request to the sensitive endpoint, attempting to access or modify data: {{crafted payload}}
3. Observe the API's response, noting the successful unauthorized access to data or execution of a restricted function
