Sensitive information becomes publicly accessible, or accessible to unauthorized entities, due to improper settings on cloud storage services. This often happens when buckets are inadvertently set to public, or access policies are too broad. Attackers can discover and exfiltrate data without needing to bypass any security controls due to the cloud storage being publicly accessible.

**Business Impact**

This vulnerability leads to reputational damage and loss of customer trust, as well as potential regulatory fines and legal action. Financial impact can be substantial as a result.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Use a public search engine or specific tools to identify publicly accessible cloud storage buckets: {{search query or tool}}
1. Browse the contents of the identified bucket directly via its URL or through a cloud storage browser: {{bucket url}}
1. Observe that sensitive files or directories are accessible without requiring any authentication or authorization.
