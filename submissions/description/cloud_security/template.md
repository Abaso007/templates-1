Cloud security vulnerabilities are any weakness in the design, implementation, operation, or management of cloud services that could be exploited by an attacker. These vulnerabilities can arise from misconfigurations, insecure coding practices, unpatched software, or inadequate security controls. Cloud security vulnerabilities allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access, compromise data, disrupt services, or abuse resources across various cloud components.

**Business Impact**

Cloud security vulnerabilities can lead to regulatory non-compliance, legal liabilities, and a significant erosion of customer trust, affecting the business's long-term viability.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Identify a potential weak point or misconfiguration in a cloud service or application: {{vulnerable component or service}}
1. Execute the exploit, attempting to gain unauthorized access, modify data, or disrupt service: {{exploit payload or action}}
1. Observe and confirm the successful exploitation
