Identity and Access Management (IAM) misconfigurations allows unauthorized users or services to perform actions they shouldn't be able to. This can occur when there are overly permissive permissions, roles are incorrectly assigned, or policies are not granular enough. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could gain elevated privileges, access sensitive resources, or disrupt cloud services.

**Business Impact**

This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, compromising data confidentiality and integrity. It can also result in financial losses due to unexpected cloud resource consumption or regulatory fines for compliance breaches.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Identify a cloud resource (e.g., S3 bucket, EC2 instance) with potentially misconfigured IAM policies: {{resource url}}
1. Attempt to access or modify the resource using credentials with insufficient intended permissions, or by exploiting an overly permissive role: {{attacker_role_or_credentials}}
1. Execute a command or API call that should normally be restricted: {{malicious_command}}
1. Observe that the unauthorized action is successfully performed
