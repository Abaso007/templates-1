Misconfigured staking logic occurs when the staking protocol does not adequately secure the staking and reward distribution mechanisms. These misconfigurations can allow an attacker to manipulate stake allocation, bypass staking requirements, or withdraw rewards without fulfilling conditions. This can result in a skewed reward distribution, allowing an attacker to unfairly increase their earnings or disrupt the staking pool.

**Business Impact**  

A compromised staking system leads to an uneven distribution of rewards, undermining user trust and reducing engagement in staking activities. The platformâ€™s reputation is affected if users perceive the staking logic as unfair or exploitable, impacting revenue and user retention.

**Steps to Reproduce** 
 
1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Stake tokens in the protocol and monitor reward distribution
1. Attempt to manipulate staking rules by performing {{action}}
1. Track if rewards are distributed inaccurately or disproportionately
1. Observe conditions such as minimum staking time or penalties are bypassed
