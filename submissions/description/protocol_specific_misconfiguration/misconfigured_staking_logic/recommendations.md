# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Enforce strict staking conditions, such as minimum staking time and penalties for early withdrawals.
- Regularly audit staking functions for proper reward calculations and accurate token transfers.
- Implement user authentication mechanisms to ensure only legitimate stakers earn rewards.
- Use a multi-signature contract for reward distributions to verify all staking transactions.
