Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Apply strict transaction validation checks to ensure each step is completed before proceeding.
- Implement multi-layered confirmation processes to verify asset transfers and state changes.
- Regularly perform audits of the transaction finalization logic for potential vulnerabilities.
- Use tools for real-time monitoring of transaction consistency to detect and flag irregularities.
