Improper validation and finalization logic vulnerabilities arise when a protocol fails to enforce finality, or confirm transactions accurately, allowing for these unconfirmed or incorrect states to be exploited. An attacker can abuse this flaw to execute unauthorized operations or manipulate state data, leading to inconsistent data states, and allowing for unauthorized asset transfers or double-spending. 

**Business Impact**

This misconfiguration can cause data discrepancies, asset losses, and conflicts within the protocol. If such issues persist, they erode trust in the platformâ€™s reliability and security, driving away users and damaging the platform's credibility. 

**Steps to Reproduce**  

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Identify a transaction or process that involves finalization
1. Perform {{action}} to interact with the system before the transaction is finalized
1. Observe that the transaction finalizes with errors or fails to validate correctly
