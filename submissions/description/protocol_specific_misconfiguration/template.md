Protocol specific misconfiguration refers to errors in the implementation or configuration of a blockchain protocol, such as consensus mechanisms, staking logic, or bridge validation. These flaws can disrupt network operations or compromise security. An attacker can exploit these misconfigurations to cause denial of service, manipulate consensus, or conduct unauthorized transactions.

**Business Impact**  

Protocol misconfigurations can destabilize the network, cause financial losses, and erode trust in the blockchain ecosystem. These issues can also impact dependent decentralized applications and associated stakeholders.

**Steps to Reproduce**  

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Analyze the protocol design and configuration for missing checks or weaknesses  {{explanation of where + screenshot}}
1. Interact with the protocol using malformed inputs or transactions 
1. Test the behavior of consensus and state transitions under stress conditions  
1. Exploit identified weaknesses to gain unauthorized control or disrupt operations
