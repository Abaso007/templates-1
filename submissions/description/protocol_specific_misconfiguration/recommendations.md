# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Conduct formal verification of protocol logic and consensus rules.  
- Regularly audit and test protocol configurations under various conditions.  
- Implement failsafes to detect and mitigate abnormal behaviors.  
- Use robust cryptographic primitives to secure protocol operations.
