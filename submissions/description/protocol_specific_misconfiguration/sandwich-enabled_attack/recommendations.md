# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Use algorithms or tools that detect and prevent sandwich attacks by adjusting transaction execution parameters.
- Implement a time-lock feature that delays transaction execution, making it harder to sandwich transactions.
- Apply techniques like randomized transaction fees or batch processing to reduce the predictability of transaction execution.
- Establish educational materials to alert users of potential sandwich attack risks and preventive measures.
