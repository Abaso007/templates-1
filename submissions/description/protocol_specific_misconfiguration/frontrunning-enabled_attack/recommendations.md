# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Implement privacy-preserving techniques such as transaction encryption to prevent frontrunning.
- Use batch processing to make transaction ordering less predictable.
- Explore fair ordering mechanisms, like the use of a commit-reveal scheme, to ensure transparent transaction sequencing.
- Regularly audit and monitor transaction ordering to detect signs of frontrunning.
