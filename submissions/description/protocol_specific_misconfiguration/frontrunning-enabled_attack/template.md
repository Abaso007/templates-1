Frontrunning-enabled attacks occur when transactions within the protocol are susceptible to being observed and prioritized by third parties, allowing attackers to insert their own transactions before the original transaction. An attacker can leverage this misconfiguration to profit by manipulating transaction ordering to their advantage. The manipulation of transaction sequences can lead to financial loss for users and disrupt market fairness.

**Business Impact**  

Frontrunning undermines user trust by creating an unfair environment in a financial application. It leads to financial losses for users and damages the protocol's reputation, as users might switch to other platforms with more transparent transaction processing.

**Steps to Reproduce**  

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Identify a function where transaction ordering could affect outcomes:
{{Function}}
1. Submit a transaction with specific parameters and track its order
1. Submit a similar transaction immediately afterward with modified parameters
1. Manipulate a transaction by {{action}} and observe that it can consistently be reordered to occur before other transactions
