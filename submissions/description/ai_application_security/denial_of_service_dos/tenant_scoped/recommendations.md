# Recommendation(s)

- Implement per-tenant resource allocation and limits.
- Isolate tenant resources and infrastructure to prevent impact on other tenants.
- Monitor individual tenant activity and resource usage for anomalies.
- Implement tenant-specific rate limiting and throttling.
- Provide detailed activity logs and monitoring dashboards to tenants.
