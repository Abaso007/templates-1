Semantic indexing occurs when the AI system's understanding and representation of meaning is flawed or inconsistent. Attackers can exploit these weaknesses to manipulate search results, retrieve incorrect information, or bypass content filters by using ambiguous or deceptive language that the system misinterprets.

**Business Impact**
Users may lose trust in the AI system's accuracy and reliability. The severity of the impact to the business is dependent on the sensitivity of the accessible data being transmitted by the application.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Craft and send the following ambiguous or deceptive queries that exploit flaws in the AI's semantic understanding:

```prompt
  {malicious prompt}
```

1. Analyze the search results or information provided by the system
1. Observe that there are cases where the system has misinterpreted the query's meaning or provided inaccurate information
