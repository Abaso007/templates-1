# Recommendation(s)

- Sanitize user-supplied input by removing or escaping RTL and LTR override characters before displaying it.
- Use a text rendering engine that properly handles or visually indicates RTL/LTR overrides.
- Display filenames and URLs with caution, providing clear context or information about the directionality of the text.
- Educate users about potential RTL/LTR override attacks and how to recognize them.
