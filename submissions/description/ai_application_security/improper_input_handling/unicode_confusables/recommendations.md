# Recommendation(s)

- Normalize and canonicalize user input by converting Unicode characters to a standard representation.
- Use allowlisting or denylisting to restrict the use of specific unicode characters.
- Display Unicode characters with visual indicators (e.g., highlighting) when there is a risk of confusion.
- Implement string comparison functions that take into account visual similarity.
