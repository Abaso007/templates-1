Insufficient rate limiting occurs when an attacker uses automated tools or scripts to send a large number of requests to the AI application. An attacker can overwhelm the server resources and degrade the performance of the application, or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) for legitimate users.

**Business Impact**
Service disruption, increased server costs, and potential for unauthorized access or data breaches. Legitimate users may be unable to access the application, impacting business operations.

**Steps to Reproduce**
1. Navigate to the following URL and observe the valid token:
1. Use the following script to send a high volume of requests to the application using the token:

```python
  {script}
```
1. Observe that the application's performance and availability are impacted under the higher load of requests
