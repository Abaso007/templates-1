# Recommendation(s)

- Implement rate limiting and throttling based on IP address or API token usage.
- Monitor API usage for unusual or excessive request patterns.
- Detect and block automated bots or scripts generating high volumes of requests.
- Revoke or invalidate stolen or compromised API tokens.
- Require API tokens to be generated and managed securely.
