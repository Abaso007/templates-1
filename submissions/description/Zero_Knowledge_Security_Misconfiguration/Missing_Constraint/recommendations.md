# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Define and implement comprehensive constraint logic during protocol and contract development.  
- Perform rigorous code reviews and formal verification of cryptographic circuits.  
- Test the system with edge cases and malicious inputs to identify missing constraints.  
- Conduct periodic audits of validation rules and update them as necessary.
