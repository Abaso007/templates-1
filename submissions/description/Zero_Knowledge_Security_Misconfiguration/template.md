Zero knowledge security misconfiguration refers to issues in the implementation of zero-knowledge proofs, such as incorrect proof validation, weak cryptographic parameters, or improper handling of proof data. These misconfigurations can undermine the privacy and security guarantees of the system. An attacker can exploit this to compromise user anonymity, bypass constraints, or manipulate system behavior.

**Business Impact**

Misconfigurations in zero-knowledge systems can lead to breaches of sensitive data, loss of user trust, and financial exploitation. Such vulnerabilities may compromise the privacy features of the application and affect compliance with regulatory requirements.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Identify the incorrect logic or missing checks the zero-knowledge proof implementation {{explanation of where + screenshot}}  
1. Generate or manipulate proofs with invalid or weak parameters 
1. Submit these proofs to the system to test if they pass verification  
1. Observe unauthorized access, privacy violations, or data leaks
