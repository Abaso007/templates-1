# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Implement rigorous validation checks for all submitted proofs.  
- Use well-tested and widely adopted cryptographic libraries for proof verification.  
- Regularly audit the proof finalization and validation logic to ensure consistency.  
- Incorporate fallback mechanisms to reject or halt processing of suspicious proofs.
