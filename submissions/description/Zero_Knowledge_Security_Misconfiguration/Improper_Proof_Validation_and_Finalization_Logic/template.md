This misconfiguration occurs when a zero-knowledge proof system fails to adequately validate or finalize proofs submitted to the protocol. This misconfiguration can arise from incorrect implementation of proof verification algorithms, missing integrity checks, or inconsistent finalization processes. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to submit invalid or fraudulent proofs, compromising the integrity of the system and potentially enabling unauthorized actions such as fund withdrawals or state alterations.

**Business Impact**

Improper validation of proofs can lead to financial losses, protocol instability, and erosion of user trust. The system may become vulnerable to exploits that undermine its cryptographic guarantees, which could have severe reputational and operational consequences.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}} 
1. Submit a zero-knowledge proof that does not adhere to the expected structure or validity criteria  
1. Observe that the system accepts the invalid proof without detecting inconsistencies
1. Attempt to finalize the proof and trigger subsequent actions, such as withdrawals or state changes  
1. Observe that the system fails to reject the invalid proof or reverts the transaction
