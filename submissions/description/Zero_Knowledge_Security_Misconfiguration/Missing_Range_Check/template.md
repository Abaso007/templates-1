This misconfiguration occurs when a blockchain protocol or smart contract fails to validate that input values fall within acceptable ranges. Without range checks, an attacker can provide extreme or invalid values, leading to overflow errors, bypassed constraints, manipulation of system behavior, Denial of Service (DoS), or unauthorized extraction of funds.

**Business Impact**  

Missing range checks can result in operational failures, financial losses, and protocol vulnerabilities. Exploits may undermine user trust, damage reputations, and lead to cascading issues across the system.

**Steps to Reproduce** 

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Inspect the input validation logic for arithmetic and cryptographic operations 
2. Submit values that exceed the expected range 
3. Observe that the system processes these inputs without detecting errors  

**Proof of Concept**
