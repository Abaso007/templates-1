# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Regularly audit zero-knowledge implementations and parameter settings.  
- Use well-established cryptographic libraries for proof generation and validation.  
- Implement rigorous input validation to detect malformed proofs.  
- Employ formal verification to ensure proof logic integrity.
