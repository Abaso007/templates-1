This misconfiguration occurs when the initialization phase of a zero-knowledge proof system or cryptographic protocol is improperly implemented. This includes issues like insecure generation of parameters, insufficient randomness, or reliance on untrustworthy parties. An attacker can exploit this misconfiguration to manipulate the trusted setup, compromising the system's security guarantees and enabling unauthorized actions.

**Business Impact**  

A misconfigured trusted setup undermines the cryptographic integrity of the system, potentially leading to financial fraud, privacy breaches, and loss of user confidence. The damage may extend to the entire ecosystem relying on the misconfigured protocol.




**Steps to Reproduce**  

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Analyze the trusted setup process and parameter generation logic  
1. Identify the point of vulnerability:
{{e.g.insufficient randomness, or insecure key generation}}  
1. Tamper with the setup process or manipulate input parameters  
4. Observe that the misconfiguration allows for unauthorized actions, or data exposure
