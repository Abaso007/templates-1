# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. This will speed triage time and result in faster rewards.

For a broken authentication or session management vulnerability, please include a simple URL or HTTP payload that can be executed to easily demonstrate and reproduce the issue.

Attempt to escalate the broken authentication or session management to perform additional actions (such as an account takeover or CSRF bypass to perform a sensitive action). If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept (PoC).
