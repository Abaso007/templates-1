# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to access the vulnerable authentication mechanism and how to exploit the vulnerability to obtain access or perform a function that is intended to enforce authentication. Include instructions on how to access the vulnerable authentication mechanism and steps to bypass it in order to perform a function or access data not intended for that user. Provide screenshots to show the functionality accessed without valid authentication.

Explain why this bypass is a risk and how it can be used as an attack vector. If safe, perform a function that is shown to require authentication. If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept here.
