# Guidance

Provide a 1-2 sentence description - see [CVE Project's Key Details Phrasing Guide](http://cveproject.github.io/docs/content/key-details-phrasing.pdf) for tips. Provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to access the vulnerable authentication mechanism and how to exploit the vulnerability to obtain access or perform a function that is intended to enforce authentication. Adding a dot-pointed walkthrough with relevant screenshots will speed triage time and result in faster rewards!

Your submission MUST include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature. For authentication bypass vulnerabilities, include instructions on how to access the vulnerable authentication mechanism and steps to bypass it in order to perform a function or access data not intended for that user. Provide screenshots to show the functionality accessed without valid authentication.

Explain why this bypass is a risk and how it can be used as an attack vector. If safe, perform a function that is shown to require authentication. Values are dependent on the type of authentication bypass or session management misconfiguration found and how the application works.
