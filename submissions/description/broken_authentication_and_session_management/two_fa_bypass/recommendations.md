# Recommendation(s)

Authentication bypass can be remediated by implementing a handful of best practices relating to authentication and session management to ensure secure implementation. These include:

- Keeping all systems, software and operating systems up-to-date with a repeatable patch management process
- Validate all user input server-side
- Ensure that the authentication mechanisms and logic are robust and that each request for a resource passes through an authorization process

The verification logic of the application, as well as all of the above, should be thoroughly tested during the development and QA phases of an application build.
