# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature. For a failure to invalidation session vulnerability, please include screenshots showing that the token is not removed from the cache and you can perform a sensitive action.

Attempt to escalate the failure to invalidate the session on password change. If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept (PoC).
