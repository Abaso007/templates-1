# Guidance

Provide a 1-2 sentence description - see [CVE Project's Key Details Phrasing Guide](http://cveproject.github.io/docs/content/key-details-phrasing.pdf) for tips. Provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to access the vulnerable authentication mechanism and how to exploit the vulnerability to obtain access or perform a function that is intended to enforce authentication. Adding a dot-pointed walkthrough with relevant screenshots will speed triage time and result in faster rewards!

Your submission MUST include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature. For a failure to invalidation session on password change vulnerability, please include a video showing the action taking place after password change, or pictures showing the password change process not removing a token from the cache and performing a sensitive action.

Attempt to escalate the failure to invalidate the session on password change. If this is possible, provide a full proof-of-concept here.
