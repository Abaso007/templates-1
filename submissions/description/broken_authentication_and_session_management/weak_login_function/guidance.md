# Guidance

Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature. For a broken authentication or session management vulnerability, please include a simple URL or HTTP payload that can be executed to easily demonstrate and reproduce the issue. This can also include a curl response from the website. For example, showing that HTTP is default or HTTPS is not available.

Attempt to escalate the broken authentication or session management to perform additional actions (such as an account takeover or CSRF bypass to perform a sensitive action). If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept (PoC).
