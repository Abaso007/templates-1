This misconfiguration occurs when a blockchain bridge fails to rigorously validate cross-chain transactions or asset transfers. This can arise from incomplete verification of cryptographic proofs, inadequate validation of source chain data, or flawed consensus mechanisms. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to forge transactions, double-spend assets, or compromise the integrity of cross-chain interactions.

**Business Impact**  

Improper validation in blockchain bridges can lead to significant financial losses, cross-chain instability, and diminished trust in the platform. Exploits may propagate vulnerabilities across multiple chains, magnifying their impact and eroding user confidence.

**Steps to Reproduce** 

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Analyze the bridge's transaction validation and verification logic.  
2. Submit a cross-chain transaction with forged or incomplete data.  
3. Observe if the bridge accepts and processes the invalid transaction.  
4. Attempt to manipulate or double-spend assets through the bridge.  
5. Confirm that the bridge fails to detect or reject the invalid transaction.
