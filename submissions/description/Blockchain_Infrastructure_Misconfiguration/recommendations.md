# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Implement secure default settings and restrict administrative access to nodes and infrastructure.  
- Regularly audit and validate network configurations against industry best practices.  
- Use automated tools to detect and resolve misconfigurations in real time.  
- Harden consensus mechanisms by enforcing robust cryptographic standards and validating peer integrity.  
- Monitor network activity to detect and mitigate potential exploits stemming from misconfigurations.
