# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature. For unnecessary data collection, please post a screenshot from a HTTP interception proxy that shows data collection that is extraneous or unnecessary.

Envision how this data could be used to perform malicious actions if obtained by an attacker. If a malicious action is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept (PoC).
