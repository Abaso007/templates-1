Blockchain Infrastructure Misconfiguration refers to weaknesses in the foundational components of a blockchain system, including nodes, consensus mechanisms, network configurations, and data integrity protocols. This can occur due to improper setup, insufficient security measures, or lack of adherence to best practices for infrastructure design and maintenance. Misconfigurations in this category can lead to systemic vulnerabilities, enabling attackers to disrupt the network, manipulate data, or exploit functionality. An attacker can leverage these misconfigurations to cause denial of service, compromise consensus, or gain unauthorized control over network operations.

**Business Impact**  

Infrastructure misconfigurations can undermine the reliability and security of the blockchain network, leading to downtime, financial losses, and erosion of trust among users and stakeholders. Such vulnerabilities can damage the reputation of the platform, expose sensitive data, and disrupt dependent decentralized applications.

**Steps to Reproduce**  

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Identify deviations from security best practice in the configuration settings of nodes and network infrastructure {{explanation of where + screenshot}}
1. Attempt to exploit weak or missing authentication for administrative access to nodes  
1. Simulate malformed transactions or messages to test the system's error-handling mechanisms  
1. Observe that the identified misconfigurations result in unauthorized access, operational disruptions, or data manipulation
