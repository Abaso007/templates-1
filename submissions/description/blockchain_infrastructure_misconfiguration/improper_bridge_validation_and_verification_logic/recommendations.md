# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Use robust cryptographic mechanisms to validate cross-chain proofs and transactions.  
- Implement multi-signature or consensus-based verification for bridge transactions.  
- Regularly audit bridge validation and verification logic to identify weaknesses.  
- Incorporate monitoring systems to flag and halt suspicious cross-chain activity.
