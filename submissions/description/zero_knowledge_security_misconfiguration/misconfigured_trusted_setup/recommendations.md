# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Use secure and well-audited processes for trusted setup parameter generation.  
- Incorporate multi-party computation (MPC) techniques to minimize reliance on single trusted entities.  
- Regularly verify the integrity of the trusted setup through independent audits.  
- Design the protocol to minimize reliance on trusted setups where feasible.
