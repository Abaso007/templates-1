# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Standardize bit lengths across all cryptographic operations and data structures.  
- Implement validation checks for bit length alignment during input processing.  
- Use widely adopted cryptographic libraries that enforce consistent bit lengths.  
- Test the system for edge cases and malformed inputs to detect vulnerabilities.
