This misconfiguration occurs when the system misaligns bit lengths during cryptographic operations, data encoding, or protocol interactions due to inconsistent implementation of data structures, or the improper handling of variable bit lengths. An attacker can exploit mismatching bit lengths to cause errors, bypass cryptographic guarantees, or inject malformed data.

**Business Impact** 

Mismatched bit lengths can lead to operational failures, security vulnerabilities, and protocol instability. Exploits may disrupt cryptographic processes, compromise data integrity, and expose the system to Denial of Service (DoS) or other attacks.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Identify a cryptographic operation or protocol process that rely on specific bit lengths 
1. Submit data with mismatched bit lengths to test the system's handling of the input  
1. Observe if the system processes or errors on invalid inputs
