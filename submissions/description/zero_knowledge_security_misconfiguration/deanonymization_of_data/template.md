This misconfiguration in zero-knowledge systems occurs when sensitive information or user identities can be inferred through patterns, metadata, or insufficient cryptographic safeguards. It often stems from poor design of the zero-knowledge circuit or improper handling of metadata. An attacker can exploit this by analyzing on-chain transactions, metadata, or computational patterns to reveal private user data.

**Business Impact**

Deanonymization undermines the privacy guarantees of zero-knowledge systems, potentially exposing users to surveillance, identity theft, or targeted attacks. This can harm user trust, lead to legal ramifications, and damage the platform's reputation.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Analyze the metadata or patterns of zero-knowledge transactions on-chain
1. Attempt to correlate transaction details with external information sources
1. Identify that there are  inconsistencies or leaks in the cryptographic implementation
1. Test if specific data inputs produce identifiable patterns in the proof output  
1. Observe the ability to infer private data or user identities from transaction analysis
