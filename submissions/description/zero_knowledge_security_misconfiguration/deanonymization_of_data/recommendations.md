# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Employ secure cryptographic designs that minimize metadata exposure.  
- Regularly audit zero-knowledge circuits for information leakage risks.  
- Use cryptographic techniques such as oblivious transfer or secure shuffling to obscure patterns.  
- Conduct privacy stress tests to ensure that data remains fully anonymized.
