# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Define and enforce range checks for all relevant inputs during system design.  
- Use libraries and frameworks with built-in range validation.  
- Test the system with edge-case and extreme values to identify missing range checks.  
- Conduct regular security audits to ensure input validation integrity.
