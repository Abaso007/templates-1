# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. This will speed triage time and result in faster rewards.

Subdomain takeovers require some form of evidence that can be viewed by the team who triage this vulnerability, once you have taken over the subdomain, hosting a file containing your Bugcrowd username or the Submission ID will be sufficient.

Describe the impact of the takeover from this subdomain to the company, what effect could this have towards their operations, their public image, how frequently is this domain used, is this meant to be public facing?
