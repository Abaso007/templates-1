# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.
This can be using a screenshot of both pages side by side with the address bar in the screenshot, or if the domain is not protecting its IP Address, a DIG showing the record for the domain and IP Address.

Describe what the impact of the WAF bypass and what an attacker can achieve after bypassing it. Do not access or attempt to access sensitive information. Do not access Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
