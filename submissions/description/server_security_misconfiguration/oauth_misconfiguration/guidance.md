# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

For an OAuth misconfiguration vulnerability, please include a screenshot or video to easily demonstrate and reproduce the issue. In the Steps to Reproduce section, please include additional steps needed to uncover the misconfiguration you have identified.

Attempt to escalate the misconfiguration to perform additional actions (such as an account takeover or insecure redirection). If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept (PoC).
