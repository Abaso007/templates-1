# Recommendation(s)

Database security is multi-tiered, relying on a number of best practices to keep the businessâ€™s data secure. The following should be kept in mind:

- Databases should have sufficient physical security. Both on premise and cloud-based databases should be located within a secure environment
- All data at rest and in transit should be encrypted with accordance to best practices
- administrative and network access controls should be managed on the principle of least privilege and these controls should be part of a regular audit and review process
- Software and hardware should be maintained inside a regular maintenance and review lifecycle
- All security controls should be part of an organization wide monitoring and audit review lifecycle
