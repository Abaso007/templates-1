# Recommendation(s)

The `Public-Key-Pins` header should not be used in modern browsers as it has been deprecated by the `Expect-CT`, which supports the Certificate Transparency framework requirements and allows sites to opt in for reporting.

The `Expect-CT` header has multiple directives which can be set for specific business needs. For more information, please see the following guides:
