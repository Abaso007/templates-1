# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. This will speed triage time and result in faster rewards.

Include a screenshot showing >400 submissions of the form in rapid succession, failing to trigger any rate limiting by the application. This must be followed with proof of the successful exploitation of the form (e.g. a successful login shown after 400 failed attempts). This demonstrates that there is no silent lockout occuring.
Do not use an IP rotation utility in attempt to bypass existing IP-based rate limiting controls. Any submission that rely on IP rotation will not considered for a reward.

Attempt to escalate the vulnerability to perform additional actions. If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept.
