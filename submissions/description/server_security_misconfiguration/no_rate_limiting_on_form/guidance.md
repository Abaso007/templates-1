Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. This will speed triage time and result in faster rewards.

Include a screenshot showing >400 submissions of the form in rapid succession, failing to trigger any rate limiting by the application.

Attempt to escalate the vulnerability to perform additional actions. If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept.
