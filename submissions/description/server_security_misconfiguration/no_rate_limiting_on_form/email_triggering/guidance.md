# Guidance

Provide a 1-2 sentence description - see [CVE Project's Key Details Phrasing Guide](http://cveproject.github.io/docs/content/key-details-phrasing.pdf) for tips. Also provide a step-by-step walkthrough with screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. This will speed triage time and result in faster rewards!

Your submission MUST include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature. For a lack of rate limiting on a form that triggers an email, please include a screenshot or video showing that multiple submissions of the form in rapid succession failed to trigger any rate limiting by the application.

Attempt to escalate the vulnerability to perform additional actions. If this is possible, provide a full proof-of-concept.
