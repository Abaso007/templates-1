# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. This will speed triage time and result in faster rewards.

Include a screenshot showing that multiple submissions of the form resulted in >400 emails being sent in rapid succession, failing to trigger any rate limiting by the application. Do not use an IP rotation utility in attempt to bypass existing IP-based rate limiting controls. Any submission that rely on IP rotation will not considered for a reward.

Attempt to escalate the vulnerability to perform additional actions. If this is possible, provide a full proof-of-concept.
