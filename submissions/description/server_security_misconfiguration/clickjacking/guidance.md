# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

For a clickjacking vulnerability, please include a simple screenshot or a HTML payload that can be executed to easily demonstrate and reproduce the issue.

Attempt to escalate the clickjacking to perform additional actions (such as an account takeover or CSRF bypass to perform a sensitive action). If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept (PoC).
