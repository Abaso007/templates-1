If possible, remove the admin portal from the internet. If remote login is required, place the admin portal behind a firewall and keep software up to date as part of a patch management lifecycle. It is also best practice to use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication for admin portals. To secure admin portals further, limit the amount of login attempts and limit access to a particular set of IP addresses.
