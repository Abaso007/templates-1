# Recommendation(s)

There is no single technique to remediate automotive security misconfigurations. However, implementing the right combination of defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact. Some best practices include the following:

- Develop and enforce secure configuration guidelines for the automotive system, incorporating guidelines for software, firmware, and network settings.
- Ensure that the vehicle's firmware is regularly updated with security patches and fixes to address known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
- Conduct regular security audits and assessments of the vehicle's configurations to identify and remediate any misconfigurations. Follow industry best practices and benchmarks for these.
