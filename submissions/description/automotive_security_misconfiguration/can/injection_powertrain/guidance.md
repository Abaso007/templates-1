# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.
For a CAN misconfiguration vulnerability, please include detailed instructions that can be followed to easily demonstrate and reproduce the issue.

Attempt to completely stop the vehicle from functioning through the CAN system. If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept (PoC) here.
