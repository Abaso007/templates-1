<!--
Provide a 1-2 sentence description - see http://cveproject.github.io/docs/content/key-details-phrasing.pdf for tips

This format is a good guide:
[VULNTYPE] in [COMPONENT] in [APPLICATION] allows [ATTACKER] to [IMPACT] via [VECTOR] 
-->

<!--
Provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to access the vulnerable injection point, and how to exploit the vulnerability.
Adding a dot-pointed walkthrough with relevant screenshots will speed triage time and result in faster rewards!
-->

<!--
Your submission MUST include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

For an IDOR, please include a simple URL or parameter that can be executed to easily demonstrate and reproduce the issue. 
-->

<!--
Attempt to escalate the IDOR to extract additional privileged information (such as using a higher privilege account to access restricted data). If this is possible, provide a full proof-of-concept here.
