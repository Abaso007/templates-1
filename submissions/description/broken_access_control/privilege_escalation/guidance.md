# Guidance

For access control vulnerabilities, include instructions on how to access the vulnerable authentication mechanism and steps to bypass it in order to perform a function or access data not intended for that user. Provide screenshots to show the functionality accessed without valid authentication.

Explain how this broken access control is a risk and how it can be used as an attack vector. If safe, perform a function that is shown to require authentication.
