# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. This will speed triage time and result in faster rewards.

Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature. For a broken access control vulnerability, please include a simple URL or HTTP payload that can be executed to easily demonstrate and reproduce the issue.

Attempt to escalate the broken access control to perform additional actions (such as an account takeover or sensitive data exposure). If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept here.
