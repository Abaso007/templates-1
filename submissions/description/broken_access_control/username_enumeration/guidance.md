# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.
For a user enumeration vulnerability, please include a simple URL or HTTP payload that can be executed to easily demonstrate and reproduce the issue.

Attempt to escalate the username enumeration to perform additional actions (such as performing additional enumeration which may not initially be present exposing additional PII). If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept (PoC) here.
