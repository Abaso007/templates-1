# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.
For this type of SSRF, the best evidence is usually a screen recording or image of incoming requests, and a summary of the data that was exfiltrated through exploitation.

As this VRT item refers to internal scans, be sure to demonstrate exactly what can be accessed internally, for example a list of active hosts. If this SSRF is not able to achieve this, take a look at some of the other SSRF VRT items to see if there is another one that is more appropriate.
