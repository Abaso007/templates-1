# Recommendation(s)

The application should only accept valid email addresses for all user accounts to minimize account abuse. Email addresses can be validated by sending a validation email with a link that the user needs to click to finalize registration of their account. It is also recommended to maintain a comprehensive and regularly updated list of known disposable email providers. This list should be used to check against the email domain used during the registration process and block any registrations using disposable email addresses.
