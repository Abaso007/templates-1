# Guidance

Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature. Attempt to escalate the vulnerability to perform additional actions. If this is possible, provide a full proof-of-concept (PoC).

For exposed critical sensitive data, please include a screenshot of both the critical sensitive data, as well as a screenshot from the HTTP interception proxy of the critical sensitive data being used successfully to perform an authenticated action or successful call to the API.
