# Disclosure of Secrets in Data Traffic Spam

## Overview of the Vulnerability

Disclosure of secrets occurs when sensitive data is not behind an authorization barrier, placing sensitive data, such as secrets or API keys, at risk. This application discloses data within data traffic spam which can enable an attacker to use secrets for privilege escalation within the application, or to send API requests on behalf of the user.

## Business Impact

Disclosure of secrets can lead to indirect financial loss through an attacker accessing, deleting, or modifying data from within the application. This could also result in reputational damage for the business through the impact to customersâ€™ trust. The severity of the impact to the business is dependent on the sensitivity of the data being stored in, and transmitted by the application.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
1 Generate data traffic by forwarding the following request multiple times to the endpoint:

```HTTP
{{request}}
```

1. Observe the disclosure of sensitive data in the HTTP interception proxy
