Server-side injection allows attackers to inject malicious code into server-side scripts. An attacker is able to manipulate the application to include a malicious script which is executed by the server and exposes sensitive data.

**Business Impact**

The vulnerability can result in data theft and manipulation, and reputational damage for the business as customers' trust is negatively impacted by an attackerâ€™s ability to access and modify data on a server.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. In a browser, navigate to the URL: {{url}}
1. Identify that the following input field that is vulnerable to injection: {{vulnerable input field}}
1. Inject the following code into the vulnerable input:
{{code}}
1. Submit the form or input data containing the injected code
1. Observe the response from the server, noticing the exposed data
