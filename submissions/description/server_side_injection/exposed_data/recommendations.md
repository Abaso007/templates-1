# Recommendation(s)

All user input should be sanitized using allow lists (valid characters and code strings), disallow lists (invalid characters and code strings), and escape sanitizing (elimination of invalid data requests). It is best practice that all user input goes through a validation process which only allows content to be processed by the server if it passes validation.
