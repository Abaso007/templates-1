Provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to access the vulnerable injection point, and how to exploit the vulnerability.
Adding a dot-pointed walkthrough with relevant screenshots will speed triage time and result in faster rewards!

<!--
Your submission MUST include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

For an SQL Injection vulnerability, please include specific NON-PII information discovered in the database, such as Database Version, a listing of database tables, or an injected 'sleep' payload.

You may present your evidence as output from a tool such as SQLMap, unless the program forbids the use of these tools, and it may be in the format of terminal output, screenshots, or video..

**DO NOT ACCESS PII**

<!--
Demonstrating access to data other than the database version or database tables is NOT permitted without explicit permission from the program.
