# Guidance

For an SQL Injection vulnerability, please include specific non-Personally Identifiable Information (PII) discovered in the database, such as Database Version, a listing of database tables, or an injected 'sleep' payload.

Demonstrating access to data other than the database version or database tables is not permitted without explicit permission from the program. Do not access Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

You may present your evidence as output from a tool such as SQLMap, unless the program forbids the use of these tools, and it may be in the format of terminal output, screenshots.

Attempt to escalate the vulnerability to perform additional actions. If this is possible, provide a full proof-of-concept.
