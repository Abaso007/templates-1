# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. This will speed triage time and result in faster rewards. Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

For a Remote Code Execution vulnerability, you may execute some commands to prove that the code execution works, but do not access or attempt to access sensitive information. Do not access Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

An example of some commands that can show access to the server are; `cat /etc/hostname`, `cat /etc/passwd`, `cat /etc/issues`, and `ifconfig`.
