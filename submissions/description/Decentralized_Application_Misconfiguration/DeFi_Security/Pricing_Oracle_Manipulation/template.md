A pricing oracle manipulation attack occurs when an attacker manipulates the data provided by price oracles to distort the prices of assets within a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocol. The vulnerability stems from the reliance on price oracles to determine asset values, particularly when these oracles draw data from a single or few external sources. Attackers may, for example, provide false liquidity to a decentralized exchange to artificially inflate or deflate the price of an asset, or target oracles with delayed price updates to profit from manipulated pricing.

**Business Impact** 

Manipulation of price oracles can destabilize the platform by causing false valuations of assets, resulting in unfair liquidations, arbitrage, or financial loss for users. This can harm the integrity of the DeFi protocol, eroding user trust, and causing significant financial losses. Additionally, legal risks arise if manipulated pricing leads to large-scale market instability or fraud within the platform.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Identify a DeFi platform relying on a price oracle for asset valuation: {{define specific platform}}
1. Determine that the price oracle uses a centralized or single-source price feed

1. Manipulate the liquidity on the platform or provide false data to the oracle
1. Observe price distortions and execute trades based on the manipulated prices to profit
> {{screenshot}}
1. Liquidate positions or perform arbitrage before the oracle updates or corrects the prices
