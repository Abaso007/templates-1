A function-level accounting error occurs when a smart contract in a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocol improperly calculates balances, interests, or other transactional values due to a coding flaw. This vulnerability typically arises from incorrect implementation of financial functions, such as rounding errors, incorrect updating of balance variables, or failing to account for edge cases in transactions. An attacker can exploit a function-level accounting error in a function responsible for updating user balances, allowing them to withdraw more funds than they are entitled to.

**Business Impact**

Function-level accounting errors can lead to significant financial discrepancies, resulting in loss of funds, misallocation of rewards, or improper liquidation of assets. This can cause reputational harm to the DeFi platform, as users may lose trust in the platform's integrity and security. Furthermore, if the error is exploited at scale, it could drain liquidity or destabilize the entire protocol.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Review the DeFi protocol's smart contract code for financial functions
1. Identify an edge case or flaw in the logic {{Describe the specific underflow, overflow, or rounding issue identified}}
1. Manipulate the inputs to the vulnerable function to trigger the flaw  
1. Observe that the protocol fails to update balances properly which results in an incorrect payout {{screenshot}}
