Governance typically involves token holders voting on protocol changes, such as interest rates or code updates. Improper implementation of governance occurs when a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocolâ€™s governance mechanism is flawed, allowing an attacker to manipulate decision making processes. This occurs when governance tokens can be easily manipulated or concentrated (e.g., through flash loans or vote buying) and can result in arbitrary changes to interest rates, fees, or smart contract logic.

**Business Impact**

This vulnerability can destabilize the protocol, leading to reputational damage, loss of user funds, and potential financial instability. Additionally, businesses may face legal consequences and regulatory scrutiny which can lead to financial losses and penalties.
