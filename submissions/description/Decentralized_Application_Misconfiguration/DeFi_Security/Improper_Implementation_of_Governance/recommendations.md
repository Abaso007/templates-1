# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures in the decentralized application can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Design governance mechanisms that distribute voting power more evenly to prevent centralization or manipulation.
- Restrict the use of flash-loaned tokens in governance votes to prevent manipulation.
- Introduce a time delay between proposal submission and vote execution to limit flash loan exploitation.
- Require longer token holding periods before tokens can be used in governance decisions to prevent vote buying.
- Regularly perform governance audits to identify and mitigate risks related to governance manipulation.
