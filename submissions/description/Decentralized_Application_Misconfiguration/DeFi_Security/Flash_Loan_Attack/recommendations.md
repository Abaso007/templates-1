# Recommendation(s)
Implementing the following defensive measures in the decentralized application can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Ensure that there are checks on price and liquidity changes to prevent sudden manipulation caused by flash loans.
- Implement replay auditing of smart contracts to detect vulnerabilities exploitable by flash loans.
- Ensure accurate, real-time price feeds from decentralized oracles to mitigate manipulation.
- Enable circuit breakers to pause the system in the event of large, suspicious transactions.
