Marketplace security misconfigurations involve weaknesses in decentralized marketplaces, such as signer account takeover, unauthorized asset transfers, or order manipulation. These flaws can compromise the integrity of transactions and lead to fraudulent activities. An attacker can exploit these misconfigurations to take over accounts, manipulate marketplace orders, or conduct unauthorized trades.

**Business Impact**  

Marketplace misconfigurations can result in user asset theft, operational disruptions, and significant reputational damage. These vulnerabilities may also cause legal and financial liabilities for the platform operators.
