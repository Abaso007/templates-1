# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures in the decentralized application can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for account access and transaction approvals.
- Use hardware wallets or other secure key management practices for storing private keys.
- Regularly monitor account activities for unusual behavior and provide alerts for unauthorized access attempts.
- Strengthen signature validation mechanisms to detect and prevent compromised keys from initiating transactions.
