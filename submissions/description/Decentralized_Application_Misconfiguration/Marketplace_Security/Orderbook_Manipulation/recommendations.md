# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures in the decentralized application can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:
- Implement strong cryptographic signature validation on all order submissions to ensure the integrity of the original terms.
- Introduce non-modifiable order hashes or unique order IDs that prevent post-signature modification.
- Regularly audit order processing logic to detect potential manipulation points.
- Provide users with clear confirmation of their orders before execution and alert them to any changes.
