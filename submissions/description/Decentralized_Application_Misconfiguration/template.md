Decentralized Application (dApp) misconfiguration refers to issues in the design or deployment of dApps, such as insecure data storage, improper authorization, or flawed logic. These vulnerabilities can compromise user security, enable unauthorized actions, or disrupt application functionality. An attacker can exploit these misconfigurations to manipulate transactions, exfiltrate data, or cause operational failures.

**Business Impact**

Misconfigured dApps can lead to data breaches, financial losses, and reputational harm. These vulnerabilities may also affect compliance with security standards and regulations.

**Steps to Reproduce**  
1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Analyze the dApp's code and configuration for potential security gaps
1. Test inputs and interactions to identify improper handling or validation  
1. Bypass security mechanisms or access restricted features {{explanation of where + screenshot}}
1. Observe any unintended behavior or unauthorized access 

**Proof of Concept**
