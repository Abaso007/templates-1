Improper authorization occurs when a decentralized application (dApp) fails to properly enforce access controls, allowing unauthorized users or entities to access restricted functionalities or resources. This can result from missing checks, weak authentication mechanisms, or flawed logic. An attacker can exploit this to gain unauthorized access, manipulate transactions, or exfiltrate sensitive information.

**Business Impact**  

Improper authorization can lead to financial losses, data breaches, and operational disruptions. Exploits may also result in regulatory non-compliance and reputational damage.

**Steps to Reproduce**  

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Analyze the authorization mechanisms in the dApp's code  
1. Attempt to bypass access controls using unauthorized accounts or inputs  
1. Test edge cases and logic flaws in the authorization process  
1. Observe that unauthorized actions are successfully executed
