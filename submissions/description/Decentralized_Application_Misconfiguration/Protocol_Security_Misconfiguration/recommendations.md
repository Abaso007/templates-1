# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Conduct thorough audits of the protocolâ€™s design and implementation.  
- Implement measures to mitigate timing-based attacks, such as transaction sequencing.  
- Use cryptographic methods to validate state transitions securely.  
- Regularly test the protocol under stress conditions to identify weaknesses.
