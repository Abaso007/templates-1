# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature. For an operating system suffering from command injection, please include a video or detailed screenshots of the steps required to exploit the command injection within the application.

Attempt to show that the command injection could be used by a malicious attacker in some impactful way. If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept (PoC).
