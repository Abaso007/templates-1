# Recommendation(s)

It is recommended to validate and parameterise all user input to seperate user entered data and commands while. Additionally, it is best practice to not call OS commands directly and instead use built in library function to perform necessary tasks.

It is also best practice to keep all operating systems and firmware up to date with the latest version and include all firmware in a patch management lifecycle with a detailed firmware upgrade plan.
