# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature. For an operating system suffering from command injection, please include a video or screenshots of the steps required to exploit the command injection within the application. If hard-coded passwords are present, please demonstrate them present within the source code.

Attempt to show how the insecurity in the OS firmware can be used by an attacker in an impactful way. If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept (PoC).
