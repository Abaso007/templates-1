# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. This will speed triage time and result in faster rewards.

Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature. For an XSS vulnerability, please include a simple URL or HTML payload that can be executed to easily demonstrate and reproduce the issue.

Attempt to escalate the XSS to perform additional actions (such as an account takeover or CSRF bypass to perform a sensitive action). If this is possible, provide a full proof-of-concept.
