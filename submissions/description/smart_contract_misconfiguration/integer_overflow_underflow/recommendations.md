# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Use libraries like `SafeMath` to prevent overflow and underflow in arithmetic operations.
- Implement input validation to restrict variable ranges.
- Perform rigorous testing on arithmetic functions under extreme conditions.
- Use static analysis tools to identify potential overflow and underflow vulnerabilities.
