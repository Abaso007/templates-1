Smart contract misconfiguration encompasses a range of issues in smart contract logic, such as reentrancy vulnerabilities, improper access control, and arithmetic errors. These flaws can lead to unauthorized actions, financial losses, or contract failures. An attacker can exploit misconfigurations to execute unintended transactions, bypass restrictions, or manipulate funds.

**Business Impact**  

Misconfigured smart contracts can result in significant financial losses, reputational damage, and legal liabilities. Exploits can destabilize the platform and harm user trust in the system.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Review the smart contract code for potential logical errors or missing validations
1. Interact with the contract using edge cases or malformed inputs
1. Observe the following points where the contract behaves unexpectedly or allows unauthorized actions {{explanation of where + screenshot}}
