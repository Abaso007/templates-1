# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Implement access control checks for sensitive or irreversible functions.
- Use `require` statements to limit access to authorized entities.
- Test all functions for reversibility or emergency recovery options.
- Document irreversible functions explicitly for user awareness.
