# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Implement strict access controls on ownership transfer functions.
- Use multi-signature wallets to manage contract ownership.
- Audit ownership and admin functions to ensure only authorized entities can access them.
- Monitor and log all owner-level activities to detect unauthorized access attempts.
