Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Use access-control libraries like `Ownable` to simplify authorization logic.
- Verify that function modifiers enforce all required checks and validations.
- Test all restricted functions to confirm the effectiveness of applied modifiers.
- Document and audit modifier logic to ensure comprehensive access control.
