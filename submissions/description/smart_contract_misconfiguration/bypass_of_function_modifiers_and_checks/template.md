This misconfiguration occurs when a smart contractâ€™s access controls or validation checks can be circumvented due to design flaws, or incorrect application of modifiers. This allows unauthorized actions or access to restricted contract functions. An attacker can exploit this misconfiguration to access privileged functions or manipulate the contract state without meeting the required conditions.

**Business Impact**
  
Bypassing modifiers and checks undermines the security and integrity of the contract, leading to potential fund loss and reputational harm. Users may lose confidence in the platform if unauthorized actions compromise its security.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Identify the critical functions that use access control or validation modifiers
1. Attempt to bypass modifiers by calling the functions directly
1. Test whether function-level validation can be circumvented using specific inputs
1. Observe inconsistencies in access control or modifier enforcement that allow unauthorized access, or other behavior that is allowed without meeting preset conditions
