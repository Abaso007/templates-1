# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Ensure proper application of access control modifiers on all sensitive functions.
- Use access control libraries like `AccessControl` for standardized security.
- Conduct thorough testing on function modifiers to prevent bypass exploits.
- Implement logging and alert mechanisms to detect unauthorized function calls.
