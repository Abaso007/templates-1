# Recommendation(s)

There is no single technique to protect from client-side injection. However, the following best practices should be adhered to:

- All client-side input data should be validated based on the content it is reasonable to contain for users
- When loading libraries or launching executable files, ensure that absolute paths are used. Do not use relative paths
