# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

For a Denial of Service (DoS), please include a simple URL or HTTP payload that can be executed to easily demonstrate and reproduce the issue.

Attempt to escalate the DoS vulnerability to perform additional actions. If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept (PoC).
