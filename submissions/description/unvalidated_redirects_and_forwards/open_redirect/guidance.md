# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. This will speed triage time and result in faster rewards.

For an open redirect vulnerability, please provide instructions on how to navigate the target to the vulnerable request and execute the redirect. Evidence can be screenshots or the raw method-path-protocol from a HTTP request and the subsequent 200 response.

Do not redirect to an unapproved third party website. Successfully redirecting to <https://bugcrowd.com/> is sufficient.
