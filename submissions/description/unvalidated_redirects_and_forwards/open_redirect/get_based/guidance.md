# Guidance

Provide a 1-2 sentence description - see [CVE Project's Key Details Phrasing Guide](http://cveproject.github.io/docs/content/key-details-phrasing.pdf) for tips.

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. This will speed triage time and result in faster rewards.

For a GET-based open redirect vulnerability, please provide instructions on how to navigate the target to the vulnerable request and execute the redirect. Evidence can be screenshots or the raw method-path-protocol from a HTTP request and the subsequent 200 response.

Do not redirect to an unapproved third party website. Successfully redirecting to <https://bugcrowd.com/> is sufficient.
