# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to execute a successful redirect via the vulnerable HTTP parameter.
Adding a dot-pointed walkthrough with relevant screenshots will speed triage time and result in faster rewards!

Your submission MUST include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

For a GET-based open redirect vulnerability, please provide instructions on how to navigate the target to the vulnerable request and execute the redirect. Evidence can be screenshots or the raw method-path-protocol from a HTTP request and the subsequent 200 response.

Do NOT redirect to an unapproved third party website. Successfully redirecting to <https://bugcrowd.com/> is sufficient.
