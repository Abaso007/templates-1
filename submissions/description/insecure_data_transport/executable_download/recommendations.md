# Recommendation(s)

It is recommended to reduce the need for downloadable executable files for the application. If they are needed for users to perform business as usual functions within the application, all downloadable files should go through an integrity check and be stored and transmitted across an encrypted network. Additionally, itâ€™s recommended that files with `.bat`, `.cmd`, and `.exe` extensions undergo additional scrutiny and be assessed for both business need and overall security check of the files.
