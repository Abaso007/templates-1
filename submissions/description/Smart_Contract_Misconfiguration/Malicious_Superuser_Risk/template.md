Malicious superuser risk occurs when a smart contract grants excessive privileges to a single admin or superuser account without appropriate checks. This can allow the privileged account to manipulate contract functionality or transfer funds at will. An attacker who gains access to the superuser account can exploit these powers to drain funds or modify contract behavior.

**Business Impact**
  
A malicious superuser can compromise the entire protocol, resulting in major financial losses, user trust erosion, and damage to the platformâ€™s integrity. Users may hesitate to interact with a contract that grants unchecked power to a single entity.

**Steps to Reproduce** 

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Identify functions that require superuser privileges within the contract
1. Using a superuser account, observe the permissions it grants
1. Modify contract parameters or transfer funds using the account
1. Observe that other accounts cannot counteract these changes
