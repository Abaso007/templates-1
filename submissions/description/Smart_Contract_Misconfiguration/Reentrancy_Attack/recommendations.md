# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Use a `checks-effects-interactions` pattern to ensure internal state updates before external calls.
- Implement `reentrancyGuard` or similar modifiers to prevent reentrancy.
- Regularly audit smart contracts for reentrancy vulnerabilities.
