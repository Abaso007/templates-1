A Reentrancy attack occurs when a smart contract calls an external contract before finalizing the state changes from its initial function. This allows an attacker to repeatedly call the vulnerable function before the first call completes, enabling them to drain funds or manipulate contract states. An attacker can exploit this misconfiguration to recursively withdraw funds beyond their initial balance.

**Business Impact** 

Reentrancy misconfiguration can lead to significant financial losses, as attackers drain funds from the contract or manipulate internal states, undermining user trust. The reputational damage can drive users away from the platform and reduce engagement with the contract.

**Steps to Reproduce** 

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Identify a contract function that calls an external contract and transfers funds
1. Deploy a malicious contract that interacts with the vulnerable function
1. Initiate a call from the malicious contract to trigger the reentrancy
1. Observe that the initial call completes without recognizing the unauthorized withdrawals
