# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Initialize all storage variables explicitly to prevent unintended defaults.
- Conduct thorough testing on variable initializations in smart contracts.
- Review code to ensure that no unassigned variables are left.
- Use static analysis tools to identify uninitialized variables before deployment.
