When a smart contract lacks restrictions on fund transfer functions, it can allow unauthorized parties to transfer funds. This misconfiguration can arise from insufficient validation of transfer functions or missing authentication checks. An attacker can exploit this flaw to move funds from the contract to their own account without permission.

**Business Impact**  

Unauthorized fund transfers can result in significant financial losses for both users and the protocol. Such incidents cause reputational damage, making users hesitant to interact with the platform and potentially leading to legal consequences.

**Steps to Reproduce** 

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Locate transfer functions within the contract
1. Execute the transfer function from an unauthorized account
1. Observe that the contract allows the transfer without proper authentication
