Improper fee implementation occurs when a smart contract applies incorrect or inconsistent fee calculations, leading to potential losses in revenue or unjust costs for users. This can stem from incorrect fee logic, lack of validation on fee amounts, or failure to update fees as needed. An attacker can exploit this misconfiguration by bypassing fees entirely or overcharging users, disrupting normal transaction behavior.

**Business Impact** 

Improper fee configurations can result in financial losses, reduced user satisfaction, and diminished trust in the platform. Users may perceive the platform as unreliable or exploitative if fees are excessive or inconsistent.

**Steps to Reproduce**  

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Review the contractâ€™s fee logic and parameters
1. Execute multiple transactions with varied amounts and compare fee deductions
1. Observe that fees deviate from expected values, or are inconsistently applied
1. Bypass or change the fee mechanism by adjusting input data
1. Observe that there is abnormal fee behavior compared to the fee policy
