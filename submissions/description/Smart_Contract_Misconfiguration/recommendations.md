# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Conduct security audits and code reviews of smart contracts.  
- Implement automated tools to detect common vulnerabilities.  
- Use modifiers and access control patterns to enforce secure logic.  
- Test contracts extensively with edge cases and different stress scenarios.
