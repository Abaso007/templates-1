# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Optimize function logic to avoid excessive looping or gas-heavy operations.
- Set usage limits on costly functions to prevent denial-of-service scenarios.
- Implement circuit-breakers to disable functions under high-stress conditions.
- Regularly test functions for performance under load to prevent DoS risks.
