A smart contract owner takeover occurs when owner or admin privileges can be acquired by an unauthorized party due to insecure permission settings. If ownership functions are misconfigured, an attacker can assume control of the contract and make arbitrary changes, including transferring funds or altering settings.

**Business Impact**  

An owner takeover can compromise the entire protocol, leading to financial and operational losses. It significantly damages user confidence, as users may lose funds or access to services and may perceive the protocol as unsafe.

**Steps to Reproduce**  

1. Navigate to the following URL: {{URL}}
1. Locate contract functions allowing ownership transfer, or admin privilege assignment
1. Call the ownership transfer function without required permissions
1. Verify new owner privileges by attempting administrative actions
1. Observe access to sensitive functions typically restricted to the owner
