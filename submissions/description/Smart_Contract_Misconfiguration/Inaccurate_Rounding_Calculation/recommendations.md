# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Use libraries with precise rounding functions and avoid excessive rounding.
- Test functions for rounding accuracy across varied input ranges.
- Standardize rounding logic in critical calculations for consistency.
- Regularly audit rounding functions to minimize financial discrepancies.
