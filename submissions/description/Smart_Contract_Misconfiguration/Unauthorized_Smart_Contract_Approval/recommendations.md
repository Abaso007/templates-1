# Recommendation(s)

Implementing the following defensive measures can prevent and limit the impact of the vulnerability:

- Enforce strict checks on token approval functions to prevent arbitrary authorization.
- Limit approvals to pre-approved addresses and verify authorization explicitly.
- Use thorough testing to confirm proper validation in approval functions.
- Regularly audit token approval processes for potential security gaps.
