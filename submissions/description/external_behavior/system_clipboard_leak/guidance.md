# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature. For this finding, please include a video of sensitive information being copied to the clipboard by some application which is then stolen by another malicious application that has access to the clipboard. 

Attempt to abuse the clipboard shared link leak further by attempting to use the shared link to perform additional actions (such as an account takeover or secret key exposure). If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept (PoC).
