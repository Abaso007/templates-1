# Recommendation(s)

The data imputed into a password field should always be obscured and this information should be sent from the client to the server using transport layer encryption. While the typed characters should be obscured as a user types them, it is best practice to include a method for the user to toggle between viewing and hiding the password so that the user can check that they have entered it correctly.
