# Recommendation(s)

Establish practices and policies that ensure responsible data collection and training. This can include:

- Conducting a comprehensive review of the training data to find and remediate biases. This includes re-sampling underrepresented groups and adjusting the model parameters to promote fairness.
- Business processes that index ethical frameworks, best practices, and concerns should be developed, monitored, and evaluated.
- Clearly define the desired outcomes of the AI model, then frame the key variables to capture.
- Ensuring that the data collected and used to train the AI model illustrates the environment that it will be deployed in and contains diverse and representative data.
- Design and develop algorithms that are sensitive to fairness considerations, and audit these regularly.
- Practice data collection principles that do not disadvantage specific groups.
- Document the development of the AI model, including all datasets, variables identified, and decisions made throughout the development cycle.
