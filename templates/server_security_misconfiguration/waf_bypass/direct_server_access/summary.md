-->

## Walkthrough & PoC
<!--
Provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to access the vulnerable injection point, and how to exploit the vulnerability.
Adding a dot-pointed walkthrough with relevant screenshots will speed triage time and result in faster rewards!

Example:

1. Browse to the URL <https://111.111.111.111>
1. Click through the certificate error
1. You will see from the HTTP title that this the IP Address for <https://secure.inscope.com> 
-->

## Vulnerability Evidence
<!--
Your submission MUST include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

This can be using a screenshot of both pages side by side with the address bar in the screenshot, or if the domain is not protecting its IP Address, a DIG showing the record for the domain and IP Address.
-->

## Demonstrated Impact
<!--
A WAF Bypass allows an attacker to bypass existing Web Application Firewall protections, leaving the web service open to attacks against the web service.
