## Walkthrough & PoC
<!--
Provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to access the vulnerable account functionality and any additional steps required to perform the account deletion.
Adding a dot-pointed walkthrough with relevant screenshots will speed triage time and result in faster rewards!

Example:

1. Browse to the user registration page and create a test account. I performed this test with user BCTestMan01.
http://<inscope>.com/registration

2. Login and click the cog at the top right next to your username.

3. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click 'Delete Account'

4. Click 'Yes' and 'I Accept' on the following prompts and the account will be deleted without needing you to enter your password.

## Vulnerability Evidence

Your submission MUST include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

When submitting, please include instructions on how to obtain a test account and steps to delete said account. Screenshots are recommended and the usernames of previous accounts you have deleted.

## Demonstrated Impact
<!--
Do NOT delete a legitimate production account of any nature. If you are unsure then reach out to program support.
