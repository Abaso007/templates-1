# Walkthrough & PoC

<!---
Provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to access the vulnerable injection point, and how to exploit the vulnerability.
Adding a dot-pointed walkthrough with relevant screenshots will speed triage time and result in faster rewards!

Video PoC walkthroughs can be added where a written walkthrough is difficult to provide.

Example:
1. Login to in-scope asset at <www.inscope.com/login>
1. Browse to account page
1. Modify ID token to add single quote
1. View error which states 'SQL Syntax Error'

# Vulnerability Evidence

<!---
Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability.

For an SQL Injection vulnerability, please include specific NON-PII information discovered in the database, such as Database Version a listing of database tables, or an injected 'sleep' payload.

DO NOT ACCESS PII

You may present your evidence as output from a tool such as SQLMap, unless the program forbids the use of these tools.
-->

# Demonstrated Impact

<!---
For SQL Injection, demonstrating access to data other than the database version or database tables is NOT permitted without explicit permission from the program.
DO NOT ACCESS PII
