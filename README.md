Directory Structure notes:

Script `generate-directories.py` grabs the current latest version of the VRT structure from GitHub and creates any missing directories. Does not remove or rename directories based on items removed from VRT.

Script follows standard entry names and keeps underscores / case as provided by VRT `id` field.
